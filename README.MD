# Worlde in the command line

## What is this?

    This is a Worlde clone that I created with Python that works in the command line.

## Why is this a thing?

    I was bored and wanted to work out the logic behind Wordle for myself.

## What did I learn from this?

    - Colorama from Fore to add color to the command line.
    - A better understanding of game loops.

## Where did I get my words from?

    - The shorter list is from the most used words from some website where I filtered it down to only 5 letter words.

    - The longer one is from a list of 5 letter words, but most of the words were too obscure to be able to guess.
